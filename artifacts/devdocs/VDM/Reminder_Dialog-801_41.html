<h1 id="reminder-dialog-80141">Reminder Dialog (801.41)</h1>
<p>This file is used to define all of the components that work together to  define a reminder dialog. Reminder dialog definitions are used by the CPRS  GUI for reminder resolution.     This file contains a combination of nationally distributed entries, local  auto-generated entries, site and VISN exchanged entries and local manually  created entries. Nationally distributed dialog, element, and group  entries have their name prefixed with VA-. Nationally distributed Prompts,  Forced Value, Result Groups, and Result Elements have their name prefixed  with PXRM. Entries in this file may be auto-generated via the Dialog  Management Menu option. Manually created dialog entries should use local  namespacing conventions. Nationally distributed entries will have their  class type defined as National. Entries created at the VISN level should be  defined as VISN and entries created at a site should be defined as Local.     This file is similar to the option file where there are different types of  entries (reminder dialog, dialog elements (sentences), prompts, and groups  of elements, result elements and groups of result elements). Where an option  has menu items, the dialog file has components that are entered, with the  sequence field as the .01 field.    A prompt is defined for PCE prompts, WH Notification Purpose, or as locally  created comment check-boxes. The prompts will not have any components within  them. PXRM-prefixed prompts are distributed in this file with the Clinical  Reminder package.     A dialog element is defined primarily to represent sentences to display in  the CPRS window with a check-box. When the user checks the sentence off, the FINDING ITEM in the dialog element and the ADDITIONAL FINDINGS will be added  to the list of PCE updates, orders, WH Notification Purposes, and mental  health tests. The updates won’t occur on the CPRS GUI until the user clicks  on the FINISH button. Dialog elements may have components added to them.  Auto-generated components will be based on the additional prompts defined in  the Finding Type Parameters. Once a dialog element is auto-generated, the  sites can modify them.     Dialog elements may also be instructional text or a header. The FINDING ITEM  and components would not be defined in dialog elements.     A dialog group is similar to menu options. It groups dialog elements and  dialog groups within its component multiple. The dialog group can be defined  with a finding item and a check-box. The components in the group can be  hidden from the CPRS GUI window until the dialog group is checked off.    A result element contains special logic that uses information entered during  the resolution process to create a sentence to add to the progress note. The  special logic contains a CONDITION that, when true, will use the ALTERNATE  PROGRESS NOTE TEXT field to update the progress note. A separate result  element is used for each separate sentence needed. The result element is  only used with mental health test finding items. Default result elements are  distributed for common mental health tests, prefixed with PXRM and the  mental health test name. Sites may copy them and modify their local versions  as needed.     A result group contains all of the result elements that need to be checked  to create sentences for one mental health test finding. The dialog element  for the test will have its RESULT GROUP/ELEMENT field defined with the  result group. Default result groups for mental health tests are distributed  with the Clinical Reminders package. Sites may copy them and modify their local  versions as needed.    Sites should name locally created items according to their local naming  convention.</p>

      <td>This is the name of the dialog entry. <br /><br />Dialogs that are auto-generated from a reminder will default to the name of <br />the reminder for ease in identifying the reminder dialog entry. Dialog <br />elements that are auto-generated use the following naming convention:  <br />Finding type prefix_ <em>Name from finding file</em> _Resolution Status. Examples <br />of two dialog element entry names generated from an Exam file entry for <br />DIABETIC EYE EXAM follow.  <br /><br />EX DIABETIC EYE EXAM DONE <br />EX DIABETIC EYE EXAM DONE ELSEWHERE <br />                                 <br />Any item created locally can use any type of naming convention. Your site <br />may want to create special namespacing for dialog entries that you create <br />locally. <br /><br />Entries prefixed with PXRM are prompts, result groups, and result elements <br />that were distributed with the Clinical Reminders package. The PXRM-prefixed <br />prompts are the additional prompts that can be asked for particular types of <br />PCE findings and WH Notification Purpose. For example: PXRM COMMENT can be <br />added to any PCE file to allow the user to enter an additional COMMENT <br />beyond the dialog element’s progress note text, and the PXRM LEVEL OF <br />UNDERSTANDING can only be used with PCE Education Topic findings.</td>

      <td>This field defines what type of dialog component this entry is. The<br />type determines the processing that can occur with this entry. <br /> <br />Reminder dialogs are the dialog entries that can be mapped to a<br />reminder definition. Reminder dialogs will typically contain several<br />dialog elements and/or dialog groups. <br /> <br />Dialog elements that are auto-generated represent a finding item and<br />resolution status combination, based on the Finding Type Parameters for<br />auto-generation. The dialog elements can be defined manually if<br />needed. Dialog elements must have the FINDING ITEM field defined in<br />order to cause the finding to be updated automatically. When no<br />finding item is defined, the dialog element is treated as a header or<br />instruction text in the CPRS GUI. Sites can also add Additional Finding<br />items to automatically update when a dialog element is checked off. An<br />example of using the additional finding would be for a dialog element<br />for a diagnosis, that must always be recorded with a second diagnosis.<br />Another example is when an Exam or Education Topic dialog element<br />checked off should automatically add an additional ICD9 and/or CPT<br />finding to PCE.<br /> <br />Dialog elements will use the DIALOG/PROGRESS NOTE TEXT to display in<br />the CPRS GUI window. This text will also be added to the progress note,<br />unless the optional ALTERNATE PROGRESS NOTE TEXT field is defined. If<br />the dialog text to display to the user needs to be different from the<br />text to add to the progress note, use the ALTERNATE PROGRESS NOTE TEXT<br />field to define the progress note text.<br /> <br />Dialog Groups can be used to group dialog elements together. Groups<br />can be displayed with a box around them and have selection rules<br />applied to them (e.g., select one, one or more)  A dialog element can<br />be changed to a dialog group by changing its TYPE.<br />Prompts are distributed in the PXRM namespace to represent additional<br />fields that the user can enter when an element is checked off. Prompts<br />are added to dialog elements during auto-generation based on the<br />finding type parameters. The PXRM COMMENT field is a generic comment<br />field that can be used on all PCE related finding items. Dialog<br />elements for “DONE ELSEWHERE” need to require the historical visit date<br />prompt. The forced value is similar to a prompt, except it represents<br />a stuffed prompt which doesn’t need to be presented to answer. The PXRM<br />prompts can be copied for local modification to create additional<br />forced value entries if necessary.<br /> <br />Prompts created locally (not copies of PXRM prompts) are treated as<br />display text with checkboxes, which, when checked off, add text to a<br />comment field which is added to the progress note text. Refer to these<br />as Local Comment Prompts.<br /> <br />Result Groups and Result Elements are distributed in the PXRM namespace<br />and are associated with Mental Health Instrument finding items during<br />auto-generation of a reminder dialog. When the mental health instrument<br />finding item dialog element is selected by the CPRS GUI user, a window<br />will be opened which contains the test’s questions and probable answers.<br />The selected answers are sent to the mental health package when the<br />user selects OK. The mental health package returns the score and<br />results which can be used within sentences. These sentences are defined<br />as Result Elements, and can vary depending on the test score. If<br />multiple sentences are possible depending on the score, the result<br />elements should be defined in a result group. The result group should<br />be added to the mental health test’s dialog elements RESULT<br />GROUP/ELEMENT field. Mental Health tests for use by Mental Health<br />clinicians only are not available for CPRS reminder resolution.<br /> <br />A reminder dialog can be made into a dialog group and added to another<br />reminder’s dialog. This allows multiple reminders to be addressed by<br />one reminder dialog.<br /> <br />Reminder Dialogs can include dialog elements that don’t have anything<br />to do with the findings defined in the reminder.<br /> <br />Taxonomy dialogs are auto-generated based on the Taxonomy Dialog<br />Parameters. The taxonomy dialog can be used as a black box that allows<br />the users to enter current or historical encounter diagnoses or<br />procedures, based on the selectable list of diagnosis parameters. <br />Alternatively, a taxonomy can have individual dialog elements created<br />for each coded value in the selectable list of diagnoses and<br />procedures. It may be more useful for sites to create dialog elements<br />for the common diagnoses and procedures they actively use and add them<br />to groups, similar to the encounter form section and coded value<br />groupings.</td>
