<p>This file defines all input/output devices that can be accessed from this CPU (definitions are not account-specific).  Each device is identified with a unique name.  Each is associated with a $I value which may correspond with a hardware port or, on layered systems, a host file or directory.  If there are several devices for the same volume set and $I, one may be given sign-on system status.  Devices may also be assigned to hunt groups to share work.  This file is cross-referenced by name, $I, volume set(CPU), and sign-on/system device.  It is also cross-referenced by hunt group, local synonym, mnemonic, subtype, and form currently mounted.</p>
