<p>This file stores TIU Templates, which are on-the-fly boilerplates that can be added to any note or addendum in the CPRS GUI.  All shared and personal templates, as well as template hierarchy, are stored within this file.   Duplicate template names are allowed, usually distinguished by personal owner.   This file is intended for the CPRS GUI only.  No server side implementation is provided or feasible.  Maintenance of this file should only be performed using the Template Editor, which is contained within the CPRS GUI.  Bypassing the template editor can cause file structure problems.</p>

      <td>The TIU TEMPLATE FILE stores templates for use in composing documents and<br />also stores the containers which organize the templates into trees. Every<br />entry in the file belongs to at least one tree.  Some entries contain<br />other entries as items.<br /> <br />There are 5 types of entries in the TIU TEMPLATE FILE:<br />      ‘T’ for TEMPLATE<br />      ‘G’ for GROUP TEMPLATE<br />      ‘C’ for CONTAINER<br />      ‘P’ for PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER<br />      ‘R’ for SHARED ROOT CONTAINER<br />      ‘TF’ for TITLE ROOT FOLDER<br />      ‘CF’ for CONSULT ROOT FOLDER<br />      ‘OF’ for PROCEDURE ROOT FOLDER <br /><br />The first two types, T and G, are true templates and may be selected<br />for composing documents.<br /> <br />The remaining types are “containers” which hold templates as items.<br />The purpose of the container types is to organize templates according<br />to subject matter into trees, so that individual templates can be easily<br />found as “leaves” of a tree.  Container types are NOT used for<br />composing documents.<br /> <br />Besides holding templates, containers may hold other containers, which<br />then function as subcontainers.<br /> <br />The last five types, P, R, TF, CF, and OF, are containers of a special<br />type, denoted “roots”.  A root functions as the single top level of its<br />tree.  Each site has a “shared” root container, which contains templates<br />shared across the whole facility.  Each user at a site has a “personal”<br />root container, which contains the user’s personal templates.  Thus, each<br />user at a site has access to two trees: the shared tree, and their own<br />personal tree.  The Title, Consult and Procedure root folders are special <br />folders that allow templates to be linked to specific TIU Titles, Consult<br />Reasons for Request, and Procedure Reasons for Request.<br /> <br />Root containers (like all container types) hold templates of type T and G,<br />and may also hold subcontainers (type C).<br /> <br />                             TYPE DETAILS <br /> ‘T’: A TEMPLATE is the most basic piece of boilerplate text desired.  It<br />may be used by itself for composing documents, or it may be added as an<br />item to a Group Template, becoming part of a larger template.<br /> <br /> ‘G’: A GROUP TEMPLATE  is a composite of its item TEMPLATES.  In addition<br />to the boilerplate text of its items, it may also have its own boilerplate<br />text. A GROUP TEMPLATE may also have items of type CONTAINER (C).  These<br />items are for storage only; they are ignored when the GROUP TEMPLATE is<br />used to compose a document.<br /> <br /> ‘C’: A CLASS CONTAINER is a container for templates. In addition to<br />templates, it may also contain other containers (C), which then function<br />as subcontainers.<br /> <br /> ‘P’: A PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER functions as the root (top level) of a<br />user’s personal template tree. A PERSONAL ROOT CONTAINER may contain both<br />shared and personal entries.<br /> <br />When adding shared entries to their personal trees, users need to be aware<br />that changes made at the facility level to a shared template will carry<br />over to their personal tree. Changes a user makes to a shared entry in<br />their personal tree do NOT, however, carry over to the shared tree.<br />Instead, when a user goes to edit a shared item under his/her PERSONAL<br />ROOT CONTAINER, that item is copied, and the user made the PERSONAL OWNER<br />of the copy. The original shared item remains the same in the shared tree.<br /> <br /> ‘R’: A SHARED ROOT CONTAINER is shared across a site.  Templates<br />contained in it may be selected by any user composing a document, but the<br />user may not edit the template itself. Besides its use for documents, a<br />site’s shared tree functions as a repository from which users can add<br />templates to their own personal tree.<br /> <br /> ‘TF’: The TITLE ROOT FOLDER links templates to specific TIU Titles.  <br />Although end users will not see this folder directly, they will see<br />templates appear automatically when the associated TIU Title is selected.<br /> <br /> ‘CF’: The CONSULT ROOT FOLDER links templates to specific Consult Reasons<br />for Request.  End users will not see this folder directly, but they will<br />see templates appear automatically when ordering a consult, and the<br />associated Consult service is selected.<br /> <br /> ‘OF’: The PROCEDURE ROOT FOLDER links templates to specific Procedure <br />Reasons for Request.  End users will not see this folder directly, but<br />they will see templates appear automatically when ordering a procedure,<br />and the associated procedure is selected.</td>

Status<br />INACTIVE serves as a way to hide entries from users composing documents.<br /> <br />INACTIVE templates are NOT available for composing documents. In theory,<br />ACTIVE templates ARE available.  In fact, however, even an ACTIVE<br />template’s select ability depends on its position in the tree, as will be<br />seen below.<br /> <br />Containers, for their part, may also have status ACTIVE or INACTIVE, and<br />may contain ACTIVE or INACTIVE items.  Thus, an INACTIVE container may<br />contain ACTIVE templates.  However, an INACTIVE container and all its<br />items (whatever status) are hidden from the user composing documents and<br />are thus not selectable.<br /> <br />Although users are permitted to have more than one Personal Root<br />Container, only one per user is allowed to be ACTIVE at a given time.<br />Similarly, a site can have only one ACTIVE Shared Root Container at a<br />given time.<br /> <br />If an entry is no longer desired for either storage or for composing<br />documents, it can be deleted.  However, once the last occurrence of it as<br />an item in any tree is deleted, it is deleted from the file itself and<br />cannot be retrieved.  Therefore, users are encouraged to INACTIVATE<br />entries rather than delete them unless they are sure they won’t want them<br />back in the future.</td>
