For consistencywith the V-file schema, it may be viewed as the "Attribute Dictionary" forthe Text Integration Utilities. It also stores Objects, which can be embedded in a Document Definition'sBoilerplate Text (Overprint). Objects contain M code which gets a piece ofdata and inserts it in the document's Boilerplate Text when a document isentered. Warning: objects embedded in boilerplate text are looked up by multipleindex (i.e. DIC(0) contains 'M'). Current code (see routine CHECK^TIUFLF3)checks all present indexes to make sure object names, abbreviations andprint names are not ambiguous for this lookup. If new indexes are added,this code MUST BE UPDATED to check the new index as well. Some entries in this file are developed Nationally and exported across thecountry.  Others are created by local sites.  Entries in the firstcategory are marked National Standard and are not editable by sites. This file does NOT allow multiple entries OF THE SAME TYPE with the samename.  That is, within a given Type, there are no duplicate names. (Thisrefers to the .01 field, the Technical name of the entry.) This file does not allow a parent to have items with the same name, evenif the items have different internal file numbers (i.e. are different fileentries).  Again, this refers to the .01 Technical name of the entry. Because of ownership considerations, the file does NOT allow an entry tobe an item under more than 1 parent.  If the same item is desired undermore than 1 parent, the item must be copied into a new entry.  There isone exception:  Document Definitions of Type Component which have beenmarked Shared may have more than one parent. The Document Definition Utility TIUF categorizes certain fields as Basic,Technical, or Upload, and displays these fields together as a group whenuser edits or views a Document Definition. BASIC fields include Name,Abbreviation, Print Name, Type, Personal Owner, Class Owner, Status, InUse, Shared, Orphan, Has Boiltxt, National Standard, OK to Distribute, andSuppress Visit Selection. TECHNICAL fields include Entry Action, ExitAction, Edit Template, Print Method, Print Form Header, Print Form Number,Print Group, Allow Custom Form Headers, Visit Linkage Method, ValidationMethod, and Object Method. UPLOAD fields include Upload Target File, LaygoAllowed, Target Text Field Subscript, Upload Look-up Method, UploadPost-Filing Code, Upload Filing Error Code, and multiples Upload CaptionedASCII Header and Upload Delimited ASCII Header. The Document Definition file contains extensive, detailed fielddescriptions. Likewise, some protocols (File 101) used in TIU haveextensive and careful descriptions in the Protocol file. Many of thesedescriptions are used in TIU for online help. If it becomes necessary fora national programmer to edit these descriptions, the programmer shouldcheck to make sure all online help is still displayed properly. Users are expected to use the Document Definition Utility TIUF to enter,edit, and delete file entries.  In fact, the file prohibits the deletionof entries through generic Fileman Options.  It also prohibits the editthrough generic Fileman of a few critical fields: Type, Status, Shared,and National Standard.  Adding and Deleting (but not editing) Items isalso prohibited through generic Fileman options.  Abbreviation and PrintName of OBJECTS cannot be edited through generic Fileman Options. This does NOT imply that it is SAFE to use generic Fileman to edit otherfields.  Users are cautioned that edit through generic Fileman bypassesmany safeguards built in to the Document Definition Utility and can createhavoc unless the user THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS the File and its uses. If users find needs which are not met through TIUF, please communicatethem to the TIU development team.                                                          ***************** WARNING: Using generic Fileman options to edit entries can cause SERIOUSdatabase problems.                                ****************</dd><dt>Fields</dt><dd><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Type</th><th>Details</th><th>Index</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>.01</td><td>name(+)</td><td>0;1</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>B</td><td>The name of a Document Definition entry (.01 field) must be between 3and 60 characters long and may not begin with a punctuation character.Although names can be entered in any case, they are transformed toupper case before being stored. It functions as the Technical Name of the entry.  Some sites have put KWICcross references on it to get, say, all Titles from a given Service. Name can be used when entering documents as the name of the Title beingentered.  Print Name and Abbreviation will also be accepted. Since it is the Technical, .01 Name, the Document Definition Utility(TIUF) uses this name throughout. The .01 name differs from the Print Name, which appears in lists ofdocuments and functions as the Title of the document. It also differs from Item Menu Text (1-20 characters), which is used whenselecting documents from 3-COLUMN MENUS. The ORDER of names in TIUF options Edit Document Definitions and CreateDocument Definitions is by Item Sequence under the parent.  Order isalphabetic by Menu Text if an Item has no Item Sequence. When a new entry is added to file 8925.1, the Document Definition Utility(TIUF) enters the Name as the default Print Name.  The Print Name can beedited if a different Print Name is desired. File 8925.1 permits more than 1 entry with the same name as long as theydon't have the same Type.  In that sense, NAMES are reusable.  However,ENTRIES are NOT reusable (except specially marked Components): an entry isNOT allowed to be an item under more than one parent unless it is a SharedComponent.  (See Type Component.) Name is a BASIC Field.                                OBJECT Name Object Names, like any other names are 3-60 characters, not starting withpunctuation.  Sites may want to namespace object names, use the objectPrint Name as a more familiar name, and use object Abbreviation as a shortname to embed in boilerplate text.  Unlike other Types, ObjectAbbreviation and Print Name as well as Name must be uppercase. Object Name, Abbreviation, or Print Name can be embedded in boilerplatetext.  Since TIU must be able to determine from this which object isintended, object Names, Abbreviations, and Print Names must be unique.  Infact, an object Name must differ not only from every other object name,but also from every other object Abbreviation and from every other objectPrint Name.  Same for Abbreviations and Print Names.  For example, if someobject has abbreviation 'CND', then 'CND' cannot be used for any otherobject Name, Abbreviation, or Print Name.</td></tr><tr><td>.02</td><td>abbreviation</td><td>0;2</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td>C</td><td>Abbreviation can be entered at the Title: prompt when entering a document.Since all Titles with that abbreviation will then be listed, Abbreviationcan serve to group Titles.

There are 5 possible types: CL CLASS:  Classes group documents. Example: "Progress Notes" is a class with many kinds of progress notesunder it. Classes may themselves be subdivided into items of Type Class or may haveitems of Type Document Class if no further Class subdivisions are desired. If a hierarchy deeper than Class-Document Class-Title is desired, Class isthe place to insert another level into the hierarchy: Class-Class-DocumentClass-Title. Besides grouping documents, Classes also store behavior which is theninherited by lower level entries. DC DOCUMENT CLASS: Document Classes group documents.  Document Class isthe lowest level of class, and has items of Type Title under it. Example: "Day Pass Note" could be a Document Class under class ProgressNote. Document Classes also store behavior which is then inherited by lowerentries. TL TITLE:  Titles are used to enter documents.  They store the behaviorof the documents which use them. Titles may have predefined boilerplate ("Overprint") text.  They may haveComponents as items.  Boilerplate Text can have objects in it. Examples: "Routine Day Pass Note" could be a Title under document classDay Pass Note.  Another example might be "Exceptional Circumstances DayPass Note." Titles store their own behavior.  They also inherit behavior from higherlevels of the hierarchy.  However, behavior stored in the Title itselfoverrides inherited behavior. CO COMPONENT: Components are "sections" or "pieces" of documents.In the Hierarchy, Components are hung as items from Titles. Examples: "Reason for Pass" could be a component of Routine Day Pass Note.Subjective is a component of a SOAP Note. Components may have (sub)Components as items.  They may have BoilerplateText.  Components may be designated Shared (see Field Description forShared). Shared Components are shown in Document Definition UtilityDisplays as Type: 'CO S'. There are advantages and disadvantages in splitting a document up intoseparate components (rather than writing sections into the BoilerplateText of the Title): Since Components are stored as separate file entries,they are inherently accessable and even 'moveable'. Using Fileman, sitescan access components of documents the same way they can access documentsfor reports, etc.. Also, in the future, TIU may have options to move/copycertain components from one document into another.  The disadvantage isspeed: Components make the structure more complex and therefore slow downprocessing. O OBJECT: Objects are names which may be embedded in the predefinedboilerplate text of Titles. Example: 'PATIENT AGE'.  Objects are typedinto the boilerplate text of a Title, enclosed by '|'s.  For example,suppose a Title has boilerplate text:         Patient is a healthy |PATIENT AGE| year old male ... Then a user who enters such a note for a patient known by the system to be56 years old would be presented with the text:         Patient is a healthy 56 year old male ... The user can then add to the text and or edit the text, including the age(56) of the patient.  From this point on, the patient age (56) is regulartext and is not updated in this note. Objects must always have uppercase names, abbreviations, and print names.When embedding objects in boilerplate text, users may embed any of thesethree (name, abbreviation, print name) in boilerplate text, enclosed by'|'s.  Objects must always be embedded in uppercase. Objects are stored in the Document Definition File, but are not part ofthe Hierarchy.  They are accessible through the Option Create Objects.(They are also accessible through the Option Sort Document Definitions, byselecting Sort by Type and selecting Type Object.) TIU exports a small library of objects.  Sites can also create their own. Only an owner can edit an object and should do so only after consultingwith others who use it.  The object must be inactive for editing.  Itshould be thoroughly tested.  See Object Status, under Status. Entries of type Object cannot be changed to any other type.  Entries oftype Class, Document Class, Title, or Component cannot be changed to typeObject. Type is a BASIC field.</td></tr><tr><td>.05</td><td>personal owner</td><td>0;5</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="200.html">200</a></td><td>AP</td><td>Document Definition Ownership has nothing to do with who can USE the entryto enter a document.  It determines responsibilty for the DocumentDefinition itself. An entry can be EDITED by its owner. (The Manager menu permits override ofownership so that Ownership can be assigned to a clinician who can thenfill in boilerplate text with the Clinician menu, while the Manager canstill edit the entry, since there are many fields the clinician does nothave access to.)  Exception: the Manager menu does NOT override ownershipof Objects or of Shared Components.  Only owners can edit Objects andShared Components, regardless of menu. If Title owner edits the boilerplate text of the Title, that person canedit the boilerplate text of all components of the Title as well, withoutregard to component ownership. In order to edit components individually,however, the user must own the component.  This allows users to assignownership of components to different people, for example, for (future)multidisciplinary documents. A PERSONAL OWNER is a person who uniquely owns the entry. An entry mayhave a Personal Owner OR a Class Owner but not both. When entering aPersonal Owner, be sure to delete any existing Class Owner. The Document Definition Utility TIUF uses the term 'Individual Owner'.Someone is an Individual Owner of an entry if s/he is the personal ownerOR, if the entry is CLASS Owned, if s/he belongs to the Owner Class. The Document Definition Utility TIUF enters the user as the Personal Ownerif a user enters a new entry without assigning ownership. This person canthen reassign ownership if they choose. If the person responsible for an entry plays a role corresponding to aUser Class, e.g. Clinical Coordinator, it may be more efficient to assignownership to the class rather than to the person.  Owners are thenautomatically updated as the class is updated. Editing privilege is affected not only by Owner but also by Status, byShared, by In Use, and by menu.  Manager menus, for example, providefuller editing capabilities than Clinician menus. Personal Owner is a BASIC field.</td></tr><tr><td>.06</td><td>class owner</td><td>0;6</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8930.html">8930</a></td><td>AC</td><td>Document Definition Ownership has nothing to do with who can USE the entryto enter a document.  It determines responsibility for the DocumentDefinition itself. An entry can be EDITED by its owner.  (The Manager menu permits overrideof ownership so that ownership can be assigned to a clinician (person withClinician Menu) who can then fill in boilerplate text, while the managercan still edit the entry, since there are many fields the clinician doesnot have access to.)  Exception: the Manager menu does NOT overrideownership of Objects or of Shared Components.  These can ONLY be edited byan owner, regardless of menu. If a Title owner edits the boilerplate text of the Title, that person canedit the boilerplate text of all components of the title as well, withoutregard to component ownership.  However, the user must own the componentin order to edit it individually, permitting separate ownership ofcomponents. A Class Owner is a User Class from the USR CLASS file whose members mayedit the entry.  An entry may have a Personal OR a Class Owner (not both).The Document Definition Utility TIUF does not prompt for Class Owner ifthe entry has a Personal Owner.  To change to Class Owner, first deletethe Personal Owner by entering '@' at the Personal Owner prompt. For new entries, users are prompted to enter the Class Owner ClinicalCoordinator as the default.  To enter a different Class Owner, enter theappropriate class after the //'s.  If there are no //'s and theReplace...with editor is being used, enter ... to replace the wholeclass and then enter the appropriate class. Class Owner is a BASIC field.</td></tr><tr><td>.07</td><td>status</td><td>0;7</td><td>POINTER</td><td><a href="8925_6.html">8925.6</a></td><td>AS</td><td>Status provides a way of making Document Definitions 'Offline' todocuments.  Document Definitions need to be 'Offline' if they are new andnot ready for use, if they are being edited, or if they are retired fromfurther use. Status is limited to those Statuses in the Status File which apply toDocument Definitions: Inactive, Test, and Active. The Document DefinitionUtility TIUF further limits Statuses to those appropriate for the entryType (see below), limits the Status of entries with Inactive ancestors toInactive, and limits the Status of faulty entries to Inactive. Status applies to all Document Definitions, but its meaning and possiblevalues vary somewhat with the Document Definition Type.  Exception: SharedComponents: See COMPONENT STATUS, below. Status is a BASIC field.                                 TITLE STATUS Status has its most basic meaning for Titles [Document Definitions of TypeTitle]: A Title can have Status Inactive, Test, or Active.  If it has StatusInactive, it cannot be used to enter documents (EXCEPT through theTry Action, which deletes the document when done). If it has StatusTest, it can be used to enter documents only by its Owner. Titles shouldbe tested (and Tried) using TEST PATIENTS ONLY.  If a Title has StatusActive, it can be used to enter documents by any one with access andauthorization.                                 *************** NOTE on Availability of Titles for entering documents: Although Status affects availability for entering documents, there areother factors which also affect availability: A Document Definition is notavailable to a given user for entering documents (excepting the DocumentDefinition Utility Try Action) unless all of the following 3 criteria aremet:   1) It is a Document Definition of Type Title.   2) It has Status Active or Test.  If it has Status Test, the userentering a document must own the Title.   3) If authorization for using the Title to enter documents is restrictedby Business Rules, the user must be a member of the authorized userclass. Unless these criteria are all met, users trying to enter documents willnot SEE the Document Definition.  Therefore it is wise to warn users whentaking definitions offline for edit, and/or to do so at nonpeak hours forentering documents. The above description applies to document entry BOTH manually throughmenu options AND via upload.  It does NOT apply to autoentry of documentsvia the TIU application interface.  Adverse Reaction/Allergy notes enteredby the Allergy package are an example of such autoentry.  The TIUapplication interface for autoentering documents disregards Title statusand Business Rules.                             ******************* When being upgraded to Status Active or Test, a Title is examined forrudimentary completeness and must be judged OK before the upgrade takesplace.  If desired, users can perform the same examination themselves byselecting action TRY.  For Titles, Action TRY also permits the user toenter a document on the entry.  The document is deleted immediately afterthe trial. Availability for entering documents is the central meaning of Status.However, Status also controls edit/deletion of Document Definitions:  ATitle can be edited ONLY if it has Status Inactive, ensuring that no oneis using it to enter a document while its behavior is changing.  Titlescan be deleted only with Status Inactive. NOTE: Although Status affects Editing ability, it is not the only factoraffecting editing:  If an entry is already IN USE by documents,editing/deletion is restricted to aspects which will not harm existingTIU documents. Components under a Title have the same status as the Title: When a Title'sstatus is changed, the statuses of its descendant Components areautomatically changed with it. (Shared Components are an exception: seeCOMPONENT STATUS, below.)                        CLASS/DOCUMENT CLASS STATUS A Document Definition of Type Class or Document Class can have StatusInactive or Active.   Basics for a Class or Document Class cannot be edited (except for Ownerand Status) unless it is Inactive.  Since Inactivating a Class/DocumentClass automatically inactivates its descendants, this ensures that allTitles which inherit behavior from it are neither Active nor Test, and arethus 'Offline' while inherited behavior is edited. In contrast to Basics, the ability to add/edit ITEMS of a Class/DocumentClass depends on the Status of the item, not the parent: it is NOTnecessary to Inactivate a Class such as Progress Notes in order toedit/add items. Activating a Class/Document Class differs from Inactivating theClass/Document Class: When a Class/Document Class is ACTIVATED, itsdescendants may have any Status which their Type permits: they are notREQUIRED to be Active. Hence, they are not automatically Activated whenthe parent is Activated.                             COMPONENT STATUS A Document Definition of Type Component has the same status as its parent:Its status can be changed only by changing the Status of its Parent, if ithas one. Components without parents are always Inactive. NOTE: The above implies that Test or Active Titles cannot have InactiveComponents.  In other words, Inactivating a Component is NOT a way ofretiring it.  If a Component is no longer a useful section of a Title, itshould be edited so as to make it useful, or it should be deleted AS ANITEM from the Title of which it is a part.  As with all retired DocumentDefinitions, it should NOT be deleted FROM THE FILE if it has been used bydocuments. Components can be edited only if they have status Inactive. This ensuresthat all Titles using them are offline while the components are beingedited. Shared Components are a special case since they can have multiple parents.They DO NOT HAVE A STATUS. They can be edited only when all parent Titleshave Status Inactive.  (The Detailed Display screen shows parents.)  Thisensures that all parent Titles of Shared Components are offline while thecomponent is being edited.  Edit of Shared Components is permitted onlythrough the Option Sort Document Definitions. Edit of Shared Components is severely restricted by Ownership, since theymay be used multiple times and across the site.  Even an Inactive Statusdoes not permit a manager (person with Manager menu) to override ownershipand edit a Shared Component they don't own.  See Shared Components, underDescription of Type.  See Description of Shared.                                OBJECT STATUS Document Definitions of Type Object have Status Inactive or Active. Only ACTIVE objects function.  That is, if a user enters a document on aTitle with boilerplate text containing an inactive object, the objectdoesn't do anything; the user sees the name of the object and an errormessage in place of the object data. Only ACTIVE objects should be embedded in boilerplate text.  Exception:owners who are creating/editing objects.  Others should NOT embed inactiveobjects in boilerplate text since they may not be ready for use and sincethey do not function when users enter documents against them. Titles whoseboilerplate text contains inactive objects cannot be activated.  (Thisdoes NOT imply that active titles never have inactive objects embedded inthem since users can, after a warning, inactivate objects even when theyare embedded in active titles.) Only INACTIVE objects can be edited (and only by an owner).  Only an ownercan activate/inactivate an object.  (Exception: if a user owns an objectand edits the owner to someone else, the user is not prevented from goingon to edit the status in the same edit session since they WERE the owner afew seconds ago.)  Active objects are assumed to be ready for use in anyboilerplate text. Since the owner is essentially caretaker of the object for the entiresite, the owner should consult with all who use it before editing it.  Anobject can be tested by embedding it in the boilerplate text of a Titleand selecting action Try for the Title.  It need not have status Activefor this testing (and SHOULD not have status Active until testing iscomplete).  Owners who inactivate objects for editing should make SURE toreactivate them if they are being used. Sites should either inactivate relevant Titles before editing objects oredit objects only when users are not likely to be ENTERING documents sinceInactive objects do not function. If a site changes the name or behavior of an Object, it is up to the SITEto change the name wherever it has already been embedded in BoilerplateText, and to inform users of the change. An object which is no longer wanted for future documents can be removedfrom the boilerplate text of all Titles and Components and then deletedfrom file 8925.1.  Only an owner can delete it.  All of the documents thatused it have already got it in hard words so there is no need to keep itfor their sake.  Old Objects should be edited so they are useful ordeleted, not kept around forever as Inactive.</td></tr><tr><td>.08</td><td>in use</td><td></td><td>COMPUTED</td><td></td><td></td><td>IN USE applies to all entries except those of Type Object.  It cannot beedited since it gets its value automatically. IN USE may have values 'Yes', 'No', or '?'. A Document Definition of Type Title or Component is In Use (Yes) if thereare entries IN THE TIU DOCUMENT file which store it as their DocumentDefinition.  If not, it is NOT used (No).  NOTE: It is possible for Document Definitions to be used by documents infiles other than the TIU Document file and still be NOT In Use since InUse means in use by documents in the TIU Document Definition file. SeeWarning, below. A Document Definition of Type Class or Document Class is In Use (Yes) ifit has children of Type Title which are In Use. That is, it is Used byDocuments (Yes) if there are entries in the TIU Document file whichinherit behavior from it. If not, it is NOT used (No). IN USE has value '?' for a Document Definition File entry if routineTIUFLF is missing or if the program encounters a nonexistent item and theentry is not In Use so far as the check has been able to go. Note: Since Shared Components can be items of more than one Title, aShared Component may be In Use even when a particular parent Title isNOT In Use.  This simply means that it is also a Component of anotherTitle which IS In Use. If IN USE has the explicit value 'No' for a particular Document Definitionentry, the entry can be deleted by the Owner without harming documents INTIU DOCUMENT FILE 8925. Deleting it will, however, orphan any descendantDocument Definitions. WARNING: If a site is using TIU to upload documents into a file other thanthe TIU Document file, it may create Document Definition entries to storeupload information.  For example, it may create an Operative Reports titlecontaining instructions for uploading documents into the Surgery file.These document definitions will be orphans and will be NOT In Use, sincedocuments using them are not stored in the TIU Document file. They mustNOT be deleted from the Document Definition file. Note: Deleting Objects will not harm existing documents, but WILL HARMfuture documents if the Object is embedded in existing Document DefinitionBoilerplate Text. If IN USE has value 'Yes' or '?', the Document Definition Utility TIUFdoes not permit the entry to be deleted. Deleting the entry would causedocuments in file 8925 not to function.  This is true even if the entryhas status 'Inactive' and documents are no longer being written on theentry. Technical Note: A Document Definition of Type Title or Component is INUSE if and only if it appears in file 8925's 'B' Cross Reference. In Use is a BASIC field.</td></tr><tr><td>.1</td><td>shared</td><td>0;10</td><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>1:YES<br/>0:NO<br/></td><td></td><td>Applies to entries of Type Component only. Document Definitions of Type Component may be designated SHARED by Ownerswho have the Manager menu. This means the Component can be an item undermultiple parents, and any user who owns a Title can add it as an item. Shared Components are the ONLY members of the Document Definitionhierarchy which can appear in more than one place in the hierarchy.(Objects can be used in multiple entries, but are not members of thehierarchy.) Shared Components are intended for broad use across the site.  An examplemight be a Privacy Act Component.  Since a Shared Component may be used inmany different Document Definitions, its Owner is essentially caretakerfor it, hospital wide, and must take into account all users before editingit.  Users who disagree with a proposed change can opt to create and usetheir own copy instead of using the Shared Component. Parents of a Shared Component are listed in the Detailed Display Screen. Shared Field values are 1 for YES and 0 for NO, with a default value of0 for NO if the field is empty. An entry may not be designated Shared unless it is of Type Component. Onlya Manager (person with Manager menu) and only an Owner can designate aComponent as Shared. Only an OWNER can edit it.  (Normally Managers canoverride ownership and edit entries.  Manager Options do NOT overrideOwnership for editing Shared Components).  Shared Components can only beedited from the Sort Document Definitions Option. Shared Components cannot be deleted.  If they do not have multipleparents, they can, however, be edited to NOT shared and THEN deleted,assuming they are not In Use by documents and the parent is Inactive. Shared Components do NOT HAVE a Status.  They can be edited only if allparent Titles are Inactive.  This ensures that parent Titles are offlinefor entering documents while their components are being edited.  Parentsare listed on the Detailed Display Screen. If a Shared Component has subcomponents, they are automatically Shared,since they, with their parents, can be used in more than one place in thehierarchy. Sharing of Document Definitions other than Components is not permittedbecause it unduly restricts the owner's right to edit/delete the DocumentDefinition and adds undue complexity to the Hierarchy. Shared is a BASIC field.</td></tr><tr><td>.11</td><td>orphan</td><td></td><td>COMPUTED</td><td></td><td></td><td>Orphan applies to Document Definitions of all Types except Objectsand Shared Components. Orphan is not editable since it gets its value automatically. Document Definitions are Orphans if they do not belong to the ClinicalDocuments Hierarchy, i.e., they cannot trace their ancestry all the wayback to the Class Clinical Documents.  If an Orphan is not In Use, itmay be "dead wood" which should be deleted from the file.  Orphans not InUse which SHOULD NOT BE DELETED include those being kept for laterpossible use, those temporarily orphaned in order to move them around inthe hierarchy, and those used for uploading documents into files otherthan the TIU Document file. (Orphan does not apply to Objects since they don't ever belong to thehierarchy.  Orphan does not apply to Shared Components since they mayhave more than one line of ancestry.) Warning:  The DOCUMENT DEFINITION file may contain orphan entries whichare not used by documents in the TIU Document file but which containupload instructions for storing documents somewhere else.  For example, ifa site is uploading Operative Reports into the Surgery file, there may bean orphan Operative Report Document Definition in the DOCUMENT DEFINITIONfile.  These should NOT be deleted just because they are orphans.  Suchentries can be identified by edit/viewing them through the Sort Optionand looking for Upload fields. NOTE: Orphan as used in the Document Definition Utility TIUF does NOT meanhaving no parents.  For example, suppose Exceptional Day Pass Note hasparent Day Pass Note.  If Day Pass Note has no parent, then ExceptionalDay Pass Note cannot trace its ancestry back to Clinical Documents and isan Orphan even though it has a parent. Orphans are invisible to TIU users and cannot be used to enter documents. When an item under a non-orphan is deleted as an item, it becomes anorphan along with all of its descendants.  TIUF, the Document DefinitionUtility, does not permit non-orphan Titles to become orphaned if they areIn Use.  Titles already used but being retired from further use shouldbe Inactivated, NOT orphaned.  Components are a different story;components being retired from further use can and should be orphaned(deleted as items from the Title). Reason: Titles inherit attributes and therefore require a completeancestry in order to process existing documents.  Since components, on theother hand, do not inherit attributes, they do NOT require a completeancestry to process existing documents (although they must remain in thefile.) Since Orphans do not belong to the Hierarchy, they do NOT appear on theEdit Document Definitions Option.  They can be accessed through the SortDocument Definitions Option. The field Orphan may have values 'Yes', 'No', or '?'. Orphan has value '?'if there are technical errors making its value unknown. Orphan is a BASIC field.</td></tr><tr><td>.12</td><td>has boiltxt</td><td></td><td>COMPUTED</td><td></td><td></td><td>Applies to Types Title and Component only.

TIU and otherpackages depend on their standard definition, and they must not be editedby sites but only by the persons who are nationally responsible for them. Such entries are marked NATIONAL STANDARD (field has value 1 for YES),which generally prevents sites from editing the entry. In two cases, sites are permitted to edit National Standard entries.  Thefirst case concerns Titles.  Sites can edit Status and Abbreviation forNational Titles.  Status INACTIVE for a National Title prevents manual andupload entry of documents for the Title, while continuing to permitautomatic entry for the Title via the TIU application interface for newnotes. (Example: Adverse Reaction/Allergy notes are automaticallyentered by the Allergy package.) Editing Abbreviation gives sites a meansof grouping national titles with other National and non-National Titles asthey please. The second case where edit of National entries is permitted concerns theItem Multiple: If a National Standard entry has Type Class or Document Class, sites canadd/delete Nonnational items as they please, and can edit ALL items ASITEMS (e.g. Item Sequence, etc.).  Sites CANNOT add/delete National items. If a National Standard entry has Type Title or Component, sitescannot add or delete items, but can still edit items AS ITEMS. Sites cannot add National Standard entries as Items to parents.  There isone exception: Sites can add National Shared Components to (nonnational)Titles if they wish.  Sites can delete National Standard Items fromnonnational parents. (Unless there has been a mistake, such items will belimited to Shared Components only.) Field is NOT heritable.  If field has no value for an entry, value is 0 bydefault.  This means that entries created by sites are NOT NationalStandard. Technical Note: National entries (except for Shared Components) must have Nationalancestors:  if a National entry has a nonNational ancestor, theDocument Definition Utility TIUF does not permit it to be activated.(Shared Components need not have National ancestors, and do not have aStatus.) National Standard is a BASIC field.</td></tr><tr><td>.14</td><td>posting indicator</td><td>0;14</td><td>SET OF CODES</td><td>C:crisis note<br/>W:warning<br/>A:allergy/ADR<br/>D:directive<br/></td><td>APOST</td><td>This field is used to help identify indicators of the Patient Posting Typeto which the Document Definition should be ascribed.</td></tr><tr><td>.15</td><td>prf flag</td><td></td><td>COMPUTED</td><td></td><td></td><td>PRF FLAG applies only to PRF titles.

Specifying a common print group fordocuments with the same headers/numbers (for example, Progress Notes havePrint Group 2, H&P's might have Print Group 7) causes such documentsfrom each print group to collate together when a mixed print is calledfor. Since documents collate first by print method, then by print group, printgroup is not necessary unless documents share a common print method. Print Group is heritable with lower level values overriding higher ones ASLONG AS the field is applicable.

Thismeans that ALL Progress Note Titles have the same header and the same formnumber.  For Class Progress Notes, Field Print Form Header holds theheader 'Progress Notes', Field Print Form Number holds Form Number 'ViceSF 509', and Field Print Group holds '2'.  Since Class Progress Notes doesnot Allow Custom Form Headers,  these field values apply for ALL ProgressNote Titles.  That is, all Progress Notes have header 'Progress Notes',Form Number 'Vice SF 509', and collate together in printouts. Field Allow Custom Field Headers also determines whether or not relatedFields Print Form Header, Print Form Number, Print Group, (and even AllowCustom Field Headers) are applicable at lower levels.  If an entry at aparticular level DOES allow Custom Form Headers, then these related fieldsDO APPLY to descendants at the next lower level.  If an entry at aparticular level DOES NOT allow Custom Form Headers, then ALL LOWER LEVELSinherit the the prohibition, and the related fields DO NOT APPLY at ANYlower levels.  Example: Since Class Progress Notes does NOT Allow Custom Form Headers,fields Print Form Header, Print Form Number, Print Group, and Allow CustomField Headers DO NOT APPLY to Document Classes or Titles under ProgressNotes.  This means that Document Definitions for documents requiringdifferent Form Headers/Numbers must be placed under a separate line ofdescent in the hierarchy; they cannot be under Progress Notes. Example: Class Clinical Documents, the Mother of all Document Definitions,does not want to REQUIRE all Document Definitions under it to use onecommon Header.  So Clinical Documents DOES Allow Custom Form Headers.Classes/Document Classes UNDER CLinical Documents can decide forthemselves whether or not to Allow Custom Headers for their own Items. Example: Class DISCHARGE SUMMARY has only one Form Header and Number whichis used by all Discharge Summary documents. So Class Discharge Summarydoes NOT Allow Custom Headers. Example: Class FORMS might contain miscellaneous documents, each usinga different Form with its own Form Header and Form Number.  So Class Formswould Allow Custom Headers. Field Allow Custom Form Headers may be set for Document Definitions ofType Class or Document Class only, and affects the DESCENDANTS of theentry for which it is set. If a DOCUMENT CLASS Allows Custom Form Headers, then TIUF, the DocumentDefinition Utility, does not permit a descendant Title to be activatedunless fields Print Form Header, Print Form Number, and Print Group have avalue (of their own or inherited).  If NO Header, or Number is desired,enter 'NONE'. If NO Print Group is desired, enter '0'. For information on editing heritable fields, see Technical field EditTemplate.</td></tr><tr><td>6.5</td><td>on browse event</td><td>6.5;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is MUMPS code which is invoked on browsing a document to fetch datafrom the Requesting Package that will be included in the display.</td></tr><tr><td>6.51</td><td>on retract event</td><td>6.51;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>This is MUMPS code which is invoked on retraction of a document to performany processing task that the Requesting Package may require.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>visit linkage method</td><td>7;E1,245</td><td>FREE TEXT</td><td></td><td></td><td>Applies to Types Class, Document Class, Title.
