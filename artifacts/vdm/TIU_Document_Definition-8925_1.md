<dt>description</dt><dd>}This file stores Document Definitions, which identify and define behavior<br/>for documents stored in the TIU DOCUMENTS FILE (#8925).  For consistency<br/>with the V-file schema, it may be viewed as the \Attribute Dictionary\ for<br/>the Text Integration Utilities.<br/> <br/>It also stores Objects, which can be embedded in a Document Definition's<br/>Boilerplate Text (Overprint). Objects contain M code which gets a piece of<br/>data and inserts it in the document's Boilerplate Text when a document is<br/>entered.<br/> <br/>Warning: objects embedded in boilerplate text are looked up by multiple<br/>index (i.e. DIC(0) contains 'M'). Current code (see routine CHECK^TIUFLF3)<br/>checks all present indexes to make sure object names, abbreviations and<br/>print names are not ambiguous for this lookup. If new indexes are added,<br/>this code MUST BE UPDATED to check the new index as well.<br/> <br/>Some entries in this file are developed Nationally and exported across the<br/>country.  Others are created by local sites.  Entries in the first<br/>category are marked National Standard and are not editable by sites.<br/> <br/>This file does NOT allow multiple entries OF THE SAME TYPE with the same<br/>name.  That is, within a given Type, there are no duplicate names. (This<br/>refers to the .01 field, the Technical name of the entry.)<br/> <br/>This file does not allow a parent to have items with the same name, even<br/>if the items have different internal file numbers (i.e. are different file<br/>entries).  Again, this refers to the .01 Technical name of the entry.<br/> <br/>Because of ownership considerations, the file does NOT allow an entry to<br/>be an item under more than 1 parent.  If the same item is desired under<br/>more than 1 parent, the item must be copied into a new entry.  There is<br/>one exception:  Document Definitions of Type Component which have been<br/>marked Shared may have more than one parent.<br/> <br/>The Document Definition Utility TIUF categorizes certain fields as Basic,<br/>Technical, or Upload, and displays these fields together as a group when<br/>user edits or views a Document Definition. BASIC fields include Name,<br/>Abbreviation, Print Name, Type, Personal Owner, Class Owner, Status, In<br/>Use, Shared, Orphan, Has Boiltxt, National Standard, OK to Distribute, and<br/>Suppress Visit Selection. TECHNICAL fields include Entry Action, Exit<br/>Action, Edit Template, Print Method, Print Form Header, Print Form Number,<br/>Print Group, Allow Custom Form Headers, Visit Linkage Method, Validation<br/>Method, and Object Method. UPLOAD fields include Upload Target File, Laygo<br/>Allowed, Target Text Field Subscript, Upload Look-up Method, Upload<br/>Post-Filing Code, Upload Filing Error Code, and multiples Upload Captioned<br/>ASCII Header and Upload Delimited ASCII Header.<br/> <br/>The Document Definition file contains extensive, detailed field<br/>descriptions. Likewise, some protocols (File 101) used in TIU have<br/>extensive and careful descriptions in the Protocol file. Many of these<br/>descriptions are used in TIU for online help. If it becomes necessary for<br/>a national programmer to edit these descriptions, the programmer should<br/>check to make sure all online help is still displayed properly.<br/> <br/>Users are expected to use the Document Definition Utility TIUF to enter,<br/>edit, and delete file entries.  In fact, the file prohibits the deletion<br/>of entries through generic Fileman Options.  It also prohibits the edit<br/>through generic Fileman of a few critical fields: Type, Status, Shared,<br/>and National Standard.  Adding and Deleting (but not editing) Items is<br/>also prohibited through generic Fileman options.  Abbreviation and Print<br/>Name of OBJECTS cannot be edited through generic Fileman Options.<br/> <br/>This does NOT imply that it is SAFE to use generic Fileman to edit other<br/>fields.  Users are cautioned that edit through generic Fileman bypasses<br/>many safeguards built in to the Document Definition Utility and can create<br/>havoc unless the user THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS the File and its uses.<br/> <br/>If users find needs which are not met through TIUF, please communicate<br/>them to the TIU development team.<br/>                           <br/>                               *****************<br/> <br/>WARNING: Using generic Fileman options to edit entries can cause SERIOUS<br/>database problems.<br/> <br/>                               ****************</dd>

### Properties

| id | fmId | label | description | datatype | location | attributes | range | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| name | .01 | Name | {::nomarkdown}The name of a Document Definition entry (.01 field) must be between 3<br/>and 60 characters long and may not begin with a punctuation character.<br/>Although names can be entered in any case, they are transformed to<br/>upper case before being stored.<br/> <br/>It functions as the Technical Name of the entry.  Some sites have put KWIC<br/>cross references on it to get, say, all Titles from a given Service.<br/> <br/>Name can be used when entering documents as the name of the Title being<br/>entered.  Print Name and Abbreviation will also be accepted.<br/> <br/>Since it is the Technical, .01 Name, the Document Definition Utility<br/>(TIUF) uses this name throughout.<br/> <br/>The .01 name differs from the Print Name, which appears in lists of<br/>documents and functions as the Title of the document.<br/> <br/>It also differs from Item Menu Text (1-20 characters), which is used when<br/>selecting documents from 3-COLUMN MENUS.<br/> <br/>The ORDER of names in TIUF options Edit Document Definitions and Create<br/>Document Definitions is by Item Sequence under the parent.  Order is<br/>alphabetic by Menu Text if an Item has no Item Sequence.<br/> <br/>When a new entry is added to file 8925.1, the Document Definition Utility<br/>(TIUF) enters the Name as the default Print Name.  The Print Name can be<br/>edited if a different Print Name is desired.<br/> <br/>File 8925.1 permits more than 1 entry with the same name as long as they<br/>don't have the same Type.  In that sense, NAMES are reusable.  However,<br/>ENTRIES are NOT reusable (except specially marked Components): an entry is<br/>NOT allowed to be an item under more than one parent unless it is a Shared<br/>Component.  (See Type Component.)<br/> <br/>Name is a BASIC Field.<br/> <br/>                               OBJECT Name <br/>Object Names, like any other names are 3-60 characters, not starting with<br/>punctuation.  Sites may want to namespace object names, use the object<br/>Print Name as a more familiar name, and use object Abbreviation as a short<br/>name to embed in boilerplate text.  Unlike other Types, Object<br/>Abbreviation and Print Name as well as Name must be uppercase.<br/> <br/>Object Name, Abbreviation, or Print Name can be embedded in boilerplate<br/>text.  Since TIU must be able to determine from this which object is<br/>intended, object Names, Abbreviations, and Print Names must be unique.  In<br/>fact, an object Name must differ not only from every other object name,<br/>but also from every other object Abbreviation and from every other object<br/>Print Name.  Same for Abbreviations and Print Names.  For example, if some<br/>object has abbreviation 'CND', then 'CND' cannot be used for any other<br/>object Name, Abbreviation, or Print Name.{:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED |  | 
| abbreviation | .02 | Abbreviation | {::nomarkdown}Abbreviation can be entered at the Title: prompt when entering a document.<br/>Since all Titles with that abbreviation will then be listed, Abbreviation<br/>can serve to group Titles.  BASIC Field.  For Objects, see NAME.{:/} | STRING |  | INDEXED |  | 
| print_name | .03 | Print Name | {::nomarkdown}Print Name is the name used in lists of documents.  For entries of Type<br/>Title, Print Name is used as the document Title in the Patient Chart.<br/>BASIC field.  For Objects, see NAME.{:/} | STRING |  | INDEXED |  | 
| type-_04 | .04 | Type | {::nomarkdown}Type determines the nature of the entry and what sort of items the entry<br/>may have. There are 5 possible types:<br/> <br/>CL CLASS:  Classes group documents.<br/> <br/>Example: \Progress Notes\ is a class with many kinds of progress notes<br/>under it.<br/> <br/>Classes may themselves be subdivided into items of Type Class or may have<br/>items of Type Document Class if no further Class subdivisions are desired.<br/> <br/>If a hierarchy deeper than Class-Document Class-Title is desired, Class is<br/>the place to insert another level into the hierarchy: Class-Class-Document<br/>Class-Title.<br/> <br/>Besides grouping documents, Classes also store behavior which is then<br/>inherited by lower level entries.<br/> <br/>DC DOCUMENT CLASS: Document Classes group documents.  Document Class is<br/>the lowest level of class, and has items of Type Title under it.<br/> <br/>Example: \Day Pass Note\ could be a Document Class under class Progress<br/>Note.<br/> <br/>Document Classes also store behavior which is then inherited by lower<br/>entries.<br/> <br/>TL TITLE:  Titles are used to enter documents.  They store the behavior<br/>of the documents which use them.<br/> <br/>Titles may have predefined boilerplate (\Overprint\) text.  They may have<br/>Components as items.  Boilerplate Text can have objects in it.<br/> <br/>Examples: \Routine Day Pass Note\ could be a Title under document class<br/>Day Pass Note.  Another example might be \Exceptional Circumstances Day<br/>Pass Note.\<br/> <br/>Titles store their own behavior.  They also inherit behavior from higher<br/>levels of the hierarchy.  However, behavior stored in the Title itself<br/>overrides inherited behavior.<br/> <br/>CO COMPONENT: Components are \sections\ or \pieces\ of documents.<br/>In the Hierarchy, Components are hung as items from Titles.<br/> <br/>Examples: \Reason for Pass\ could be a component of Routine Day Pass Note.<br/>Subjective is a component of a SOAP Note.<br/> <br/>Components may have (sub)Components as items.  They may have Boilerplate<br/>Text.  Components may be designated Shared (see Field Description for<br/>Shared). Shared Components are shown in Document Definition Utility<br/>Displays as Type: 'CO S'.<br/> <br/>There are advantages and disadvantages in splitting a document up into<br/>separate components (rather than writing sections into the Boilerplate<br/>Text of the Title): Since Components are stored as separate file entries,<br/>they are inherently accessable and even 'moveable'. Using Fileman, sites<br/>can access components of documents the same way they can access documents<br/>for reports, etc.. Also, in the future, TIU may have options to move/copy<br/>certain components from one document into another.  The disadvantage is<br/>speed: Components make the structure more complex and therefore slow down<br/>processing.<br/> <br/>O OBJECT: Objects are names which may be embedded in the predefined<br/>boilerplate text of Titles. Example: 'PATIENT AGE'.  Objects are typed<br/>into the boilerplate text of a Title, enclosed by '|'s.  For example,<br/>suppose a Title has boilerplate text:<br/> <br/>        Patient is a healthy |PATIENT AGE| year old male ...<br/> <br/>Then a user who enters such a note for a patient known by the system to be<br/>56 years old would be presented with the text:<br/> <br/>        Patient is a healthy 56 year old male ...<br/> <br/>The user can then add to the text and or edit the text, including the age<br/>(56) of the patient.  From this point on, the patient age (56) is regular<br/>text and is not updated in this note.<br/> <br/>Objects must always have uppercase names, abbreviations, and print names.<br/>When embedding objects in boilerplate text, users may embed any of these<br/>three (name, abbreviation, print name) in boilerplate text, enclosed by<br/>'|'s.  Objects must always be embedded in uppercase.<br/> <br/>Objects are stored in the Document Definition File, but are not part of<br/>the Hierarchy.  They are accessible through the Option Create Objects.<br/>(They are also accessible through the Option Sort Document Definitions, by<br/>selecting Sort by Type and selecting Type Object.)<br/> <br/>TIU exports a small library of objects.  Sites can also create their own.<br/> <br/>Only an owner can edit an object and should do so only after consulting<br/>with others who use it.  The object must be inactive for editing.  It<br/>should be thoroughly tested.  See Object Status, under Status.<br/> <br/>Entries of type Object cannot be changed to any other type.  Entries of<br/>type Class, Document Class, Title, or Component cannot be changed to type<br/>Object.<br/> <br/>Type is a BASIC field.{:/} | ENUMERATION |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>DC</dt><dd>DOCUMENT CLASS</dd><dt>O</dt><dd>OBJECT</dd><dt>CO</dt><dd>COMPONENT</dd><dt>CL</dt><dd>CLASS</dd><dt>DOC</dt><dd>TITLE</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| personal_owner | .05 | Personal Owner | {::nomarkdown}Document Definition Ownership has nothing to do with who can USE the entry<br/>to enter a document.  It determines responsibilty for the Document<br/>Definition itself.<br/> <br/>An entry can be EDITED by its owner. (The Manager menu permits override of<br/>ownership so that Ownership can be assigned to a clinician who can then<br/>fill in boilerplate text with the Clinician menu, while the Manager can<br/>still edit the entry, since there are many fields the clinician does not<br/>have access to.)  Exception: the Manager menu does NOT override ownership<br/>of Objects or of Shared Components.  Only owners can edit Objects and<br/>Shared Components, regardless of menu.<br/> <br/>If Title owner edits the boilerplate text of the Title, that person can<br/>edit the boilerplate text of all components of the Title as well, without<br/>regard to component ownership. In order to edit components individually,<br/>however, the user must own the component.  This allows users to assign<br/>ownership of components to different people, for example, for (future)<br/>multidisciplinary documents.<br/> <br/>A PERSONAL OWNER is a person who uniquely owns the entry. An entry may<br/>have a Personal Owner OR a Class Owner but not both. When entering a<br/>Personal Owner, be sure to delete any existing Class Owner.<br/> <br/>The Document Definition Utility TIUF uses the term 'Individual Owner'.<br/>Someone is an Individual Owner of an entry if s/he is the personal owner<br/>OR, if the entry is CLASS Owned, if s/he belongs to the Owner Class.<br/> <br/>The Document Definition Utility TIUF enters the user as the Personal Owner<br/>if a user enters a new entry without assigning ownership. This person can<br/>then reassign ownership if they choose.<br/> <br/>If the person responsible for an entry plays a role corresponding to a<br/>User Class, e.g. Clinical Coordinator, it may be more efficient to assign<br/>ownership to the class rather than to the person.  Owners are then<br/>automatically updated as the class is updated.<br/> <br/>Editing privilege is affected not only by Owner but also by Status, by<br/>Shared, by In Use, and by menu.  Manager menus, for example, provide<br/>fuller editing capabilities than Clinician menus.<br/> <br/>Personal Owner is a BASIC field.{:/} | POINTER |  | INDEXED | [New_Person-200](New_Person-200.md) | 
| class_owner | .06 | Class Owner | {::nomarkdown}Document Definition Ownership has nothing to do with who can USE the entry<br/>to enter a document.  It determines responsibility for the Document<br/>Definition itself.<br/> <br/>An entry can be EDITED by its owner.  (The Manager menu permits override<br/>of ownership so that ownership can be assigned to a clinician (person with<br/>Clinician Menu) who can then fill in boilerplate text, while the manager<br/>can still edit the entry, since there are many fields the clinician does<br/>not have access to.)  Exception: the Manager menu does NOT override<br/>ownership of Objects or of Shared Components.  These can ONLY be edited by<br/>an owner, regardless of menu.<br/> <br/>If a Title owner edits the boilerplate text of the Title, that person can<br/>edit the boilerplate text of all components of the title as well, without<br/>regard to component ownership.  However, the user must own the component<br/>in order to edit it individually, permitting separate ownership of<br/>components.<br/> <br/>A Class Owner is a User Class from the USR CLASS file whose members may<br/>edit the entry.  An entry may have a Personal OR a Class Owner (not both).<br/>The Document Definition Utility TIUF does not prompt for Class Owner if<br/>the entry has a Personal Owner.  To change to Class Owner, first delete<br/>the Personal Owner by entering '@' at the Personal Owner prompt.<br/> <br/>For new entries, users are prompted to enter the Class Owner Clinical<br/>Coordinator as the default.  To enter a different Class Owner, enter the<br/>appropriate class after the //'s.  If there are no //'s and the<br/>Replace...with editor is being used, enter ... to replace the whole<br/>class and then enter the appropriate class.<br/> <br/>Class Owner is a BASIC field.{:/} | POINTER |  | INDEXED | Usr_Class-8930 | 
| status | .07 | Status | {::nomarkdown}Status provides a way of making Document Definitions 'Offline' to<br/>documents.  Document Definitions need to be 'Offline' if they are new and<br/>not ready for use, if they are being edited, or if they are retired from<br/>further use.<br/> <br/>Status is limited to those Statuses in the Status File which apply to<br/>Document Definitions: Inactive, Test, and Active. The Document Definition<br/>Utility TIUF further limits Statuses to those appropriate for the entry<br/>Type (see below), limits the Status of entries with Inactive ancestors to<br/>Inactive, and limits the Status of faulty entries to Inactive.<br/> <br/>Status applies to all Document Definitions, but its meaning and possible<br/>values vary somewhat with the Document Definition Type.  Exception: Shared<br/>Components: See COMPONENT STATUS, below.<br/> <br/>Status is a BASIC field.<br/> <br/>                                TITLE STATUS<br/> <br/>Status has its most basic meaning for Titles [Document Definitions of Type<br/>Title]:<br/> <br/>A Title can have Status Inactive, Test, or Active.  If it has Status<br/>Inactive, it cannot be used to enter documents (EXCEPT through the<br/>Try Action, which deletes the document when done). If it has Status<br/>Test, it can be used to enter documents only by its Owner. Titles should<br/>be tested (and Tried) using TEST PATIENTS ONLY.  If a Title has Status<br/>Active, it can be used to enter documents by any one with access and<br/>authorization.  <br/> <br/>                              *************** <br/>NOTE on Availability of Titles for entering documents: <br/>Although Status affects availability for entering documents, there are<br/>other factors which also affect availability: A Document Definition is not<br/>available to a given user for entering documents (excepting the Document<br/>Definition Utility Try Action) unless all of the following 3 criteria are<br/>met:<br/> <br/>  1) It is a Document Definition of Type Title.<br/> <br/>  2) It has Status Active or Test.  If it has Status Test, the user<br/>entering a document must own the Title.<br/> <br/>  3) If authorization for using the Title to enter documents is restricted<br/>by Business Rules, the user must be a member of the authorized user<br/>class.<br/> <br/>Unless these criteria are all met, users trying to enter documents will<br/>not SEE the Document Definition.  Therefore it is wise to warn users when<br/>taking definitions offline for edit, and/or to do so at nonpeak hours for<br/>entering documents.<br/> <br/>The above description applies to document entry BOTH manually through<br/>menu options AND via upload.  It does NOT apply to autoentry of documents<br/>via the TIU application interface.  Adverse Reaction/Allergy notes entered<br/>by the Allergy package are an example of such autoentry.  The TIU<br/>application interface for autoentering documents disregards Title status<br/>and Business Rules.<br/>                             *******************<br/> <br/>When being upgraded to Status Active or Test, a Title is examined for<br/>rudimentary completeness and must be judged OK before the upgrade takes<br/>place.  If desired, users can perform the same examination themselves by<br/>selecting action TRY.  For Titles, Action TRY also permits the user to<br/>enter a document on the entry.  The document is deleted immediately after<br/>the trial.<br/> <br/>Availability for entering documents is the central meaning of Status.<br/>However, Status also controls edit/deletion of Document Definitions:  A<br/>Title can be edited ONLY if it has Status Inactive, ensuring that no one<br/>is using it to enter a document while its behavior is changing.  Titles<br/>can be deleted only with Status Inactive.<br/> <br/>NOTE: Although Status affects Editing ability, it is not the only factor<br/>affecting editing:  If an entry is already IN USE by documents,<br/>editing/deletion is restricted to aspects which will not harm existing<br/>TIU documents.<br/> <br/>Components under a Title have the same status as the Title: When a Title's<br/>status is changed, the statuses of its descendant Components are<br/>automatically changed with it. (Shared Components are an exception: see<br/>COMPONENT STATUS, below.)<br/> <br/>                       CLASS/DOCUMENT CLASS STATUS<br/> <br/>A Document Definition of Type Class or Document Class can have Status<br/>Inactive or Active.  <br/> <br/>Basics for a Class or Document Class cannot be edited (except for Owner<br/>and Status) unless it is Inactive.  Since Inactivating a Class/Document<br/>Class automatically inactivates its descendants, this ensures that all<br/>Titles which inherit behavior from it are neither Active nor Test, and are<br/>thus 'Offline' while inherited behavior is edited.<br/> <br/>In contrast to Basics, the ability to add/edit ITEMS of a Class/Document<br/>Class depends on the Status of the item, not the parent: it is NOT<br/>necessary to Inactivate a Class such as Progress Notes in order to<br/>edit/add items.<br/> <br/>Activating a Class/Document Class differs from Inactivating the<br/>Class/Document Class: When a Class/Document Class is ACTIVATED, its<br/>descendants may have any Status which their Type permits: they are not<br/>REQUIRED to be Active. Hence, they are not automatically Activated when<br/>the parent is Activated.<br/> <br/>                            COMPONENT STATUS<br/> <br/>A Document Definition of Type Component has the same status as its parent:<br/>Its status can be changed only by changing the Status of its Parent, if it<br/>has one. Components without parents are always Inactive.<br/> <br/>NOTE: The above implies that Test or Active Titles cannot have Inactive<br/>Components.  In other words, Inactivating a Component is NOT a way of<br/>retiring it.  If a Component is no longer a useful section of a Title, it<br/>should be edited so as to make it useful, or it should be deleted AS AN<br/>ITEM from the Title of which it is a part.  As with all retired Document<br/>Definitions, it should NOT be deleted FROM THE FILE if it has been used by<br/>documents.<br/> <br/>Components can be edited only if they have status Inactive. This ensures<br/>that all Titles using them are offline while the components are being<br/>edited.<br/> <br/>Shared Components are a special case since they can have multiple parents.<br/>They DO NOT HAVE A STATUS. They can be edited only when all parent Titles<br/>have Status Inactive.  (The Detailed Display screen shows parents.)  This<br/>ensures that all parent Titles of Shared Components are offline while the<br/>component is being edited.  Edit of Shared Components is permitted only<br/>through the Option Sort Document Definitions.<br/> <br/>Edit of Shared Components is severely restricted by Ownership, since they<br/>may be used multiple times and across the site.  Even an Inactive Status<br/>does not permit a manager (person with Manager menu) to override ownership<br/>and edit a Shared Component they don't own.  See Shared Components, under<br/>Description of Type.  See Description of Shared.<br/> <br/>                               OBJECT STATUS<br/> <br/>Document Definitions of Type Object have Status Inactive or Active.<br/> <br/>Only ACTIVE objects function.  That is, if a user enters a document on a<br/>Title with boilerplate text containing an inactive object, the object<br/>doesn't do anything; the user sees the name of the object and an error<br/>message in place of the object data.<br/> <br/>Only ACTIVE objects should be embedded in boilerplate text.  Exception:<br/>owners who are creating/editing objects.  Others should NOT embed inactive<br/>objects in boilerplate text since they may not be ready for use and since<br/>they do not function when users enter documents against them. Titles whose<br/>boilerplate text contains inactive objects cannot be activated.  (This<br/>does NOT imply that active titles never have inactive objects embedded in<br/>them since users can, after a warning, inactivate objects even when they<br/>are embedded in active titles.)<br/> <br/>Only INACTIVE objects can be edited (and only by an owner).  Only an owner<br/>can activate/inactivate an object.  (Exception: if a user owns an object<br/>and edits the owner to someone else, the user is not prevented from going<br/>on to edit the status in the same edit session since they WERE the owner a<br/>few seconds ago.)  Active objects are assumed to be ready for use in any<br/>boilerplate text.<br/> <br/>Since the owner is essentially caretaker of the object for the entire<br/>site, the owner should consult with all who use it before editing it.  An<br/>object can be tested by embedding it in the boilerplate text of a Title<br/>and selecting action Try for the Title.  It need not have status Active<br/>for this testing (and SHOULD not have status Active until testing is<br/>complete).  Owners who inactivate objects for editing should make SURE to<br/>reactivate them if they are being used.<br/> <br/>Sites should either inactivate relevant Titles before editing objects or<br/>edit objects only when users are not likely to be ENTERING documents since<br/>Inactive objects do not function.<br/> <br/>If a site changes the name or behavior of an Object, it is up to the SITE<br/>to change the name wherever it has already been embedded in Boilerplate<br/>Text, and to inform users of the change.<br/> <br/>An object which is no longer wanted for future documents can be removed<br/>from the boilerplate text of all Titles and Components and then deleted<br/>from file 8925.1.  Only an owner can delete it.  All of the documents that<br/>used it have already got it in hard words so there is no need to keep it<br/>for their sake.  Old Objects should be edited so they are useful or<br/>deleted, not kept around forever as Inactive.{:/} | POINTER |  | INDEXED | TIU_Status-8925_6 | 
| shared | .1 | Shared | {::nomarkdown}Applies to entries of Type Component only.<br/> <br/>Document Definitions of Type Component may be designated SHARED by Owners<br/>who have the Manager menu. This means the Component can be an item under<br/>multiple parents, and any user who owns a Title can add it as an item.<br/> <br/>Shared Components are the ONLY members of the Document Definition<br/>hierarchy which can appear in more than one place in the hierarchy.<br/>(Objects can be used in multiple entries, but are not members of the<br/>hierarchy.)<br/> <br/>Shared Components are intended for broad use across the site.  An example<br/>might be a Privacy Act Component.  Since a Shared Component may be used in<br/>many different Document Definitions, its Owner is essentially caretaker<br/>for it, hospital wide, and must take into account all users before editing<br/>it.  Users who disagree with a proposed change can opt to create and use<br/>their own copy instead of using the Shared Component.<br/> <br/>Parents of a Shared Component are listed in the Detailed Display Screen.<br/> <br/>Shared Field values are 1 for YES and 0 for NO, with a default value of<br/>0 for NO if the field is empty.<br/> <br/>An entry may not be designated Shared unless it is of Type Component. Only<br/>a Manager (person with Manager menu) and only an Owner can designate a<br/>Component as Shared. Only an OWNER can edit it.  (Normally Managers can<br/>override ownership and edit entries.  Manager Options do NOT override<br/>Ownership for editing Shared Components).  Shared Components can only be<br/>edited from the Sort Document Definitions Option.<br/> <br/>Shared Components cannot be deleted.  If they do not have multiple<br/>parents, they can, however, be edited to NOT shared and THEN deleted,<br/>assuming they are not In Use by documents and the parent is Inactive.<br/> <br/>Shared Components do NOT HAVE a Status.  They can be edited only if all<br/>parent Titles are Inactive.  This ensures that parent Titles are offline<br/>for entering documents while their components are being edited.  Parents<br/>are listed on the Detailed Display Screen.<br/> <br/>If a Shared Component has subcomponents, they are automatically Shared,<br/>since they, with their parents, can be used in more than one place in the<br/>hierarchy.<br/> <br/>Sharing of Document Definitions other than Components is not permitted<br/>because it unduly restricts the owner's right to edit/delete the Document<br/>Definition and adds undue complexity to the Hierarchy.<br/> <br/>Shared is a BASIC field.{:/} | BOOLEAN |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>0</dt><dd>false</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>true</dd></dl>{:/} | 
| national_standard | .13 | National Standard | {::nomarkdown}Some Document Definitions, for example, CWAD's, are developed nationally<br/>and sent out as standardized entries across the nation.  TIU and other<br/>packages depend on their standard definition, and they must not be edited<br/>by sites but only by the persons who are nationally responsible for them.<br/> <br/>Such entries are marked NATIONAL STANDARD (field has value 1 for YES),<br/>which generally prevents sites from editing the entry.<br/> <br/>In two cases, sites are permitted to edit National Standard entries.  The<br/>first case concerns Titles.  Sites can edit Status and Abbreviation for<br/>National Titles.  Status INACTIVE for a National Title prevents manual and<br/>upload entry of documents for the Title, while continuing to permit<br/>automatic entry for the Title via the TIU application interface for new<br/>notes. (Example: Adverse Reaction/Allergy notes are automatically<br/>entered by the Allergy package.) Editing Abbreviation gives sites a means<br/>of grouping national titles with other National and non-National Titles as<br/>they please.<br/> <br/>The second case where edit of National entries is permitted concerns the<br/>Item Multiple:<br/> <br/>If a National Standard entry has Type Class or Document Class, sites can<br/>add/delete Nonnational items as they please, and can edit ALL items AS<br/>ITEMS (e.g. Item Sequence, etc.).  Sites CANNOT add/delete National items.<br/> <br/>If a National Standard entry has Type Title or Component, sites<br/>cannot add or delete items, but can still edit items AS ITEMS.<br/> <br/>Sites cannot add National Standard entries as Items to parents.  There is<br/>one exception: Sites can add National Shared Components to (nonnational)<br/>Titles if they wish.  Sites can delete National Standard Items from<br/>nonnational parents.

This<br/>means that ALL Progress Note Titles have the same header and the same form<br/>number.  For Class Progress Notes, Field Print Form Header holds the<br/>header 'Progress Notes', Field Print Form Number holds Form Number 'Vice<br/>SF 509', and Field Print Group holds '2'.  Since Class Progress Notes does<br/>not Allow Custom Form Headers,  these field values apply for ALL Progress<br/>Note Titles.  That is, all Progress Notes have header 'Progress Notes',<br/>Form Number 'Vice SF 509', and collate together in printouts.<br/> <br/>Field Allow Custom Field Headers also determines whether or not related<br/>Fields Print Form Header, Print Form Number, Print Group, (and even Allow<br/>Custom Field Headers) are applicable at lower levels.  If an entry at a<br/>particular level DOES allow Custom Form Headers, then these related fields<br/>DO APPLY to descendants at the next lower level.  If an entry at a<br/>particular level DOES NOT allow Custom Form Headers, then ALL LOWER LEVELS<br/>inherit the the prohibition, and the related fields DO NOT APPLY at ANY<br/>lower levels.<br/>  <br/>Example: Since Class Progress Notes does NOT Allow Custom Form Headers,<br/>fields Print Form Header, Print Form Number, Print Group, and Allow Custom<br/>Field Headers DO NOT APPLY to Document Classes or Titles under Progress<br/>Notes.  This means that Document Definitions for documents requiring<br/>different Form Headers/Numbers must be placed under a separate line of<br/>descent in the hierarchy; they cannot be under Progress Notes.<br/> <br/>Example: Class Clinical Documents, the Mother of all Document Definitions,<br/>does not want to REQUIRE all Document Definitions under it to use one<br/>common Header.  So Clinical Documents DOES Allow Custom Form Headers.<br/>Classes/Document Classes UNDER CLinical Documents can decide for<br/>themselves whether or not to Allow Custom Headers for their own Items.<br/> <br/>Example: Class DISCHARGE SUMMARY has only one Form Header and Number which<br/>is used by all Discharge Summary documents. So Class Discharge Summary<br/>does NOT Allow Custom Headers.<br/> <br/>Example: Class FORMS might contain miscellaneous documents, each using<br/>a different Form with its own Form Header and Form Number.  So Class Forms<br/>would Allow Custom Headers.<br/> <br/>Field Allow Custom Form Headers may be set for Document Definitions of<br/>Type Class or Document Class only, and affects the DESCENDANTS of the<br/>entry for which it is set.<br/> <br/>If a DOCUMENT CLASS Allows Custom Form Headers, then TIUF, the Document<br/>Definition Utility, does not permit a descendant Title to be activated<br/>unless fields Print Form Header, Print Form Number, and Print Group have a<br/>value (of their own or inherited).

| caption | .01 | Caption | {::nomarkdown}NOTE: Users can choose between two possible kinds of Upload Record<br/>Headers: Captioned or Delimited.  Captioned headers should be used UNLESS<br/>the site has a way to generate upload headers automatically.<br/> <br/>CAPTION is the caption which the transcriber enters into the captioned<br/>upload record header immediately preceeding the item data.  It serves to<br/>distinguish one item of data from the next. Example: PATIENT NAME{:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED |  | 
| item_name | .02 | Item Name | {::nomarkdown}This is the name of the item in the ASCII message header.  Item Name is<br/>used in help messages for the person dictating a document.{:/} | STRING |  | INDEXED |  | 
| field_number | .03 | Field Number | {::nomarkdown}This is the FIELD # in the target file which corresponds to this header<br/>item and where this item of data will be stored.{:/} | STRING |  | INDEXED |  | 
| lookup_local_variable_name | .04 | Lookup Local Variable Name | {::nomarkdown}This field specifies the local variable name into which this item of the<br/>upload header will be set.  The local variable is used by the Look-Up<br/>Method.  For example, if this item of the header is the patient social<br/>security number, the Lookup Local Variable Name might be TIUSSN.  The<br/>social security number as written by the transcriptionist is first<br/>transformed by any existing Transform Code, and then set into this<br/>variable (e.g. TIUSSN) for use in Look-Up Method code.<br/> <br/>Lookup Local Variable Name is necessary only if the information in this<br/>piece is required in order to look up the appropriate entry in the target<br/>file.{:/} | STRING |  | INDEXED |  | 
| example_entry | .05 | Example Entry | {::nomarkdown}This field is used to store sample data for this item in the form the<br/>transcriptionist is expected to use when transcribing it.  For example, if<br/>a patient has social security number 555-12-1212, and the transcriptionist<br/>is expected to write 555-12-1212, than an Example Entry should have the<br/>form 555-12-1212.<br/> <br/>The Upload needs to know the exact form the transcriptionist is expected<br/>to use in case it needs to transform it to make it acceptable to FileMan.<br/>In this case, the transcriptionist also needs to know the exact form.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  | 
| clinician_must_dictate | .06 | Clinician Must Dictate | {::nomarkdown}States whether or not this item should be dictated by the Clinician.  Will<br/>be used by the Clinician Help routine to determine if this field should be<br/>shown as data that should be dictated.  (Some items can be entered by the<br/>transcriber without being dictated, such as the transcriber<br/>identification).{:/} | BOOLEAN |  |  | {::nomarkdown}<dl><dt>0</dt><dd>false</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>true</dd></dl>{:/} |

| item | .01 | Item | {::nomarkdown}Items are themselves Document Definitions.  The Type of the parent entry<br/>determines what Types of items it has.  A parent entry of type Class has<br/>items of type Class or Document Class.  A Document Class entry has items<br/>of type Title.  If a Title entry has more than a single section, it has<br/>items of type Component.  Components may also be multi-section with items<br/>of type Component.  Objects do not have items.{:/} | POINTER |  | REQUIRED, INDEXED | TIU_Document_Definition-8925_1 | 
| mnemonic | 2 | Mnemonic | {::nomarkdown}Item Mnemonic is a handle by which to select Classes/Document Classes from<br/>a menu. 1-4 characters long.  Mnemonic is usually numeric with the same<br/>value as the Sequence.  Alpha mnemonics are permitted if preferred.{:/} | STRING |  |  |  | 
| sequence | 3 | Sequence | {::nomarkdown}Item Sequence, if entered, determines item's order under its parent. If<br/>items have no sequence, item order is alphabetic by item Menu Text.<br/>Sequence must be between .01 and 999.{:/} | NUMERIC |  | INDEXED |  | 
| menu_text | 4 | Menu Text | {::nomarkdown}Item Menu Text is the short name users will see for Classes and Document<br/>Classes when selecting them from 3-COLUMN MENUS.  Document Definitions are<br/>selected from 3-column menus when viewing documents across many patients<br/>and when viewing many kinds of documents at the same time (e.g. Progress<br/>Notes and Discharge Summaries).<br/> <br/>To edit the Menu Text of a Document Definition, you must be viewing the<br/>Document Definition as an ITEM of its PARENT. Select 'Detailed Display'<br/>for the PARENT and then 'Items'.<br/> <br/>Menu Text has 1 - 20 characters. Menu Text must not begin with a space or<br/>with 'All'.  The Document Definition Utility TIUF automatically sets the<br/>Item Menu Text to the first 20 characters of the Item's Name when an entry<br/>is first added as an item. (If an entry's Name begins with 'All' its Menu<br/>Text is given 'AlX' as its first 3 characters.) The utility does NOT<br/>update Menu Text if the entry Name is later changed, since this would<br/>overwrite what a site may have carefully set up.  Menu Text is required.<br/> <br/>Menu Text can affect item order under a parent since order is alphabetic<br/>by menu text if items do not have sequence numbers.{:/} | STRING |  | REQUIRED |  |
