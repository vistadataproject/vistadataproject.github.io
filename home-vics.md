## VA Modernization with Continuity of Care
The Veterans Health Information Systems Technology and Architecture ([VistA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VistA)) is the comprehensive lifelong inpatient-outpatient clinical, business, and administrative information system that manages all veteran care of the U.S.  Veterans Health Administration ([VHA](https://www.va.gov/health/aboutVHA.asp)). 130 VistA systems support the operations of over 1200 VA hospitals and clinics nationwide.

The _Veteran Integraged Cloud Services (VICS)_ project demonstrates how to safely migrate functionality from the 130 decentralized VistA systems to single centralized commercial cloud-based services -  __Veteran Integrated Cloud Service (VICS)__ - ensuring seamless continuity of veteran care and enabling enterprise-wide transition of VistA services to a new commercially-supported health information system.


__Strategic Benefits__:


  * Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining each of the 130 distinct, decentralized VISTA systems as single centralized cloud services during multi-year VA modernization transition.
  * Migrate VISTA from decentralized legacy VA data centers to single centralized Federally-certified commercial cloud without disturbing veteran care
  *  Safely and incrementally transition and decomission VistA systems and services using a proven centralized enterprise-wide approach - rather than migrating each unique VistA one at a time in a decentralized approach - all while maintaining seamless continuity of veteran care.
  * All VistA clients (CPRS/JLV) and workflows are fully supported and secured enterprise-wide in the VA Cloud during the decomissioning of the back-end VistA services.
  * Implement commodity commercial clinical (EHR) and business (ERP) services enterprise-wide while preserving veteran-specific care and services.
  *  Implements state-of-the-art real-time cloud monitoring and security of all veteran health data systems and services.


## Background

The Veteran Integrated Cloud Services (VICS) project has progressed in two phases.

* __VICS Discovery (FY16-17)__: In the VistA Metadata Audit, Analytics, and Automation project, the operational data model of the VA VistA systems is exposed and translated to an industry-standard machine-processable form. The VistA Data Model (VDM) is audited, and normalized to create a Master Veteran Data model (MVDM), which provides a modern, secure, symmetric, standards-based, model-driven read-write interface across all 130 VistA systems. The transactional business model of VistA's enterprise-wide clients (CPRS) is also exposed and translated industry-standard form, and emulated as cloud-based centralized services. This centralization and emulation of VistA's enterprise-wide interface provides VA an enterprise-wide approach to retirement of the Vista systems and services, rather than the current approach of per-VistA retirement, and provides an enterprise approach to maintaining all of the Vista services during the multi-year transtion to a commercially supported health information system.
* __VICS Operations (FY18-20)__: In the VistA Adaptive Maintenance project, MVDM and its secure read-write service interfaces to CPRS are operationalized - via remote proceedure call  routing - to VA's new Federally-mandated, HIPAA-secured enterprise commercial cloud leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS).
